**Clarifying questions from Part 1, which are meant to be sent to our team leader for review and eventually the company.**

1. Does the company prioritize speed or accuracy for our model results?


2. Is this the first time integrating Data Science/ML models to forecast churn rates?
 - If not, what were the previous results? is the data accessible? What was the outcome?
    

3. Is there infrastructure in place to continously monitor, manage and enhance the model?


4. Who will be receiving the final report?
 - Do they undertand model technicalities/fundamentals?
 
 
5. Any additional data points the company can share and/or are easily accessible? 
 - Phone types, prices? Competitors that clients have 'jumped ship' to?
 - More information on clients? (state, city, zip code, region, income or credit scores)
