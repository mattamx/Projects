# TripleTen_projects
All the cool projects I worked on during the TripleTen Data Science bootcamp. You'll track my evolution as a data scientist as I progress and learn more complex topics. You'll find me experimenting with various methods of exploratory data analysis and machine learning throughout the sprints.

| Project | Title | `Overview` | `Task`
| :---------------: | --------------- |--------------- | --------------- |
| Final Project | Churn Rate Forecasting | A telecom operator wants to forecast customers who might be planning on leaving its service. Those in danger of churning will be offered promotional codes and special plans. | Explore the fragmented dataframes, perform a clean-up before consolidation and run a variety of machine learning models to achieve an optimal set of predictions. 
| Computer Vision | Neural Network Activation | A supermarket chain would like to explore the introduction of a computer vision system to help them adhere to alcohol laws. | Develop and train a convolutional neural network model on a GPU platform, using thousands of photos of people to predict the approximate age of customers. Obtain a MAE score under 8. 
| Machine Learning for Texts | Movie Review Sentiment Detection | An online film community is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. | Build a machine learning model to automatically detect negative sentiments of text from IMDB movie reviews with polarity analysis and reach an F1 score above a target threshold of 0.85.
| Time Series | Taxi Service Forecasting | To be updated | To be updated
