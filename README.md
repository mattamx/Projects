# TripleTen_projects
All the cool projects I worked on during the TripleTen Data Science bootcamp. You'll track my evolution as a data scientist as I progress and learn more complex topics. You'll find me experimenting with various methods of exploratory data analysis and machine learning throughout the sprints.
