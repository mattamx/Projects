# TripleTen Sprint 1 - [Basic Python](TripleTen Projects/Sprint 1 - Working with Data in Python/Basic Python.ipynb)

### What we learned throughout the sprint:

- Different data types like str, float, and int; Python’s data structures like list and dict.
- For loops and conditions with if and else.
- Local and global variables as well as functions and their parameters.
- pandas: the key library for data manipulation and wrangling.

### Brief

Using real Yandex.Music data, analyzing the music preferences of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville comparing user behavior for these two cities.

#### Task

Test the three following hypotheses: 
1) User activity differs depending on the day of the week and from city to city.
2) On Monday mornings, Springfield and Shelbyville residents listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday evenings.
3) Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In both Springfield and Shelbyville, they prefer pop.

#### The Data

The data is spread across five files:

- `name`: first and last name of actor (director)
- `character`: character played (for actors)
- `role`: the person’s contribution to the title (it can be in the capacity either of actor or director)
- `title`: title of movie (show)
- `type`: show or movie
- `genres`: list of genres under which the movie (show) falls
- `release_year`: year when the movie (show) was released
- `imdb_score`: score on IMDb
- `imdb_votes`: votes on IMDb


#### The Process

The quality of the data is evaluated on whether its issues (if any) are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, we account for the most critical problems.

#### Results

Through data analysis (leveraging pre-coded cells) we tested three hypotheses, accepting our first hypothesis while rejecting the two remaining.

None at the moment. Leaving as-is since it was my first introduction into all of this.
